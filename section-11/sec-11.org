This is the fun (read: optional!) section to show how to manipulate
and visualize spatial data in $\R$.  It seems more fun to start with a
data story; and work through some basic analysis.  

Data.gov is a data repository administered by the US government with
over 445,000 geographic data sets.  One dat set is the geographic
coordinates and characteristics of 7,863 farmers marketsin the United
States.[fn:: https://explore.data.gov/d/wfna-38ey] Suppose we are
interested in examining the effect of state boundaries on the
characteristics of farmers markets.  Do state boundaries have a
substantive impact on the character of farmers markets, or are the no
better than arbitrary lines.  There are rigorous ways to address this
question, but we will just classify and plot farmers markets, looking
for spatial patterns that follow state boundaries.

First, we export the farmers market data set as a CSV file, saving it
to the data directory as \code{farmers-mkts.csv}. Let's just plot the
distribution of farmers markets on a a base map of the United States.
To do this, you will need to install and then load the following
libraries:

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :file inserts/us-mkts.png :tangle yes :session
  library(maps)
  library(maptools)
  library(RColorBrewer)
  library(classInt)
  library(gpclib)
  library(mapdata)
  
  data <- read.csv("../data/farmers-mkts.csv", header=TRUE)
  map("state", interior = FALSE)
  map("state", boundary = FALSE, col = "gray", add = TRUE)
  points(data$x, data$y, cex = 0.2, col="blue")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:inserts/graph1.png]]

The distribution of farmers markets across the US is neat to see, but
there are so many points that it is difficult to visually glean any
useful information, as seen in the following figure.  So, instead,
lets only consider the farmers markets in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico,
and Arizona.  There are 354 farmers markets in these four states.

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
  statelist <- c("New Mexico", "Colorado", "Arizona", "Utah")
  idx <- is.element(data$State, statelist) 
  state.data <- data[idx, ]
  dim(state.data)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] 354

Each column of the \code{state.data} data frame contains information
on a different attribute of the farmers markets.  The last 24 columns
are binary variables with entries \code{"Y"} or \code{"N"}, indicating
whether the market sells cheese, for example, or accepts credit cards.
These are the attributes of interest.  The idea is whether we can
predict the state of the farmers market, purely based on the
characteristics.  If so, then the state boundaries are correlated with
the attributes for some reason --- which is not included in the scope
of this example.  We can extract these characteristics into a matrix
$\X$ and recode the string variables to 0-1 binary variables.  Note
that the default numeric levels of the string variables are 2 and 3,
so subtracting 2 will yield the desired result.

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
  X <- state.data[, 8:ncol(state.data)]
  for(i in names(X)) {
    X[[i]] <- as.numeric(X[[i]]) - 2
  }
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

We want to categorize the markets based on their characteristics into
four distinct buckets, indicating one of the four states.  For this,
we can use K-Means clustering, which is a simple call in $\R$.  The
resulting object \code{cl} is a list with various output attributes of
the clustering, including to which of the four clusters each market
was assigned, indicated by \code{cl\$cluster}.  This is the vector we
will use to color the points on the map.  There are many other
attributes that are collected in \code{cl}; three of them are listed
below.

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :exports both :tangle yes :session
  cl <- kmeans(X, 4)
  names(cl)[1:3]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] "cluster" "centers" "totss"

The following code plots the points by zooming in on the four states,
and coloring each market by the predicted state.  There is slight
variation in the output map, as $\Rs$ selects the exact colors on the
fly.  Below, we save the resulting image to
\code{inserts/limited-mkts.png} and display one such image, produced
previously.  I won't describe this code in detail, but see [[g][this post]]
for a fuller description of what's going on.

#+begin_src R :exports code :tangle yes :session
nclr <- 4
plotclr <- brewer.pal(nclr, "Set1")
class <- classIntervals(plotvar, nclr, style = "pretty")
colcode <- findColours(class, cl$cluster)
png("inserts/limited-mkts.png")
map("state", interior = FALSE, 
    xlim = c(-117, -101), ylim = c(28, 43))
map("state", boundary = FALSE, col="gray", add = TRUE, 
    xlim = c(-117, -101), ylim = c(28, 43))
points(state.data$x, state.data$y, pch = 16, col= colcode, cex = 1)
dev.off()
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

[[file:inserts/farmers-markets-final.png]]

This is cool.  It is clear that there is some separable variation in
the characteristics of the markets.  The red points seem to be
clustered in New Mexico, the lower-right state.  Even markets right
across the border have characteristics that are different enough to
"correctly" cluster them by state.  There must be something about
state regulations that are particularly imposing in New Mexico. \\

This is just one of many neat examples about how to use $\Rs$ to
examine spatial variation; and to effectively uncover some spatial,
data generating processes that are not obvious from looking at the
data in a matrix or spreadsheet.  More to come!
